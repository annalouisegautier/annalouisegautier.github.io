I am a [Digital Futures Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/research/postdoc-fellowships/postdoc-fellowships-ongoing-projects/designing-rules-for-multi-robot-systems/) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology where I work with [Jana Tumova](https://www.kth.se/profile/tumova) in the Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning. I am affilated with the WASP-Nest Project on Perceiving and Communicating Correct-by-Design Sociably Acceptable Autonomous Systems [(PerCorSo)](https://wasp-sweden.org/nest-project-percorso/) and the Vinnova Center on Trustworthy Edge Computing Systems and Applications [(TECoSA)](https://www.tecosa.center.kth.se/).

My research interests center around planning and decision making in multi-agent systems. I often consider planning under uncertainty (e.g., MDPs, MMDPs, CMMDPs)and game theory and mechanism design (e.g., auctions). I consider both multi-robot systems and mixed human-and-robot systems.

I received my PhD from the University of Oxford in 2023. My thesis was entitled "Resource Allocation for Constrained Multi-Agent Systems" and was supervised by [Nick Hawes](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~nickh/) and [Micheal Wooldridge](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.wooldridge/). Prior to that, I received my MSc in Applied Mathematics from the London School of Economics. I recieved my BA in Mathematics and my BS in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis.

<i>I am currently advertising some Master's thesis projects at the Division of Robotics, Perception, and Learning. Send me an email for more information.</i>
