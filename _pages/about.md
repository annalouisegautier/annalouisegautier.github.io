I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at [Chalmers University of Technology](https://www.chalmers.se/en/). I am affiliated with the Division of Data Science and AI. My research interests center around planning and decision making in multi-agent systems. I often consider planning under uncertainty (e.g., MDPs, MMDPs, CMMDPs) and game theory and mechanism design (e.g., auctions). I am particularly interested application to multi-robot systems and mixed, human-and-robot systems.

Prior to joining KTH, I was a [Digital Futures Postdoctoral Fellow](https://www.digitalfutures.kth.se/mobility-projects/designing-rules-for-multi-robot-systems/) at KTH Royal Institute of Technology where I worked with [Jana Tumova](https://www.kth.se/profile/tumova) in the Division of Robotics, Perception and Learning. I was affiliated with the WASP-Nest Project on Perceiving and Communicating Correct-by-Design Sociably Acceptable Autonomous Systems [(PerCorSo)](https://wasp-sweden.org/nest-project-percorso/) and the Vinnova Center on Trustworthy Edge Computing Systems and Applications [(TECoSA)](https://www.tecosa.center.kth.se/).

I received my PhD from the University of Oxford in 2023. My thesis was entitled "Resource Allocation for Constrained Multi-Agent Systems" and was supervised by [Nick Hawes](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~nickh/) and [Michael Wooldridge](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/people/michael.wooldridge/). Prior to that, I received my MSc in Applied Mathematics from the London School of Economics. I received my BA in Mathematics and my BS in Computer Science from Washington University in St. Louis.
